# -Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-ANN
---
## 🔍 Overview

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using patient health data and a deep learning model built with Keras (TensorFlow). Early and accurate prediction of heart disease can aid in preventive healthcare and clinical decision-making.

## 📊 Dataset

Source: UCI Heart Disease Dataset (CSV format)
Features: 13 patient attributes (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)
Target: Binary classification
1 = Heart disease present
0 = No heart disease

## 🧠 Model: Artificial Neural Network

Architecture:
Input layer: 32 neurons, ReLU
Hidden layer: 16 neurons, ReLU
Output layer: 1 neuron, Sigmoid
Techniques Used:
Feature Standardization
Dropout Regularization
EarlyStopping for training efficiency
Train-validation-test split for robust evaluation
---
## 📈 Results

Test Accuracy: ~86–90% (depending on train-test split)
Evaluation Metrics:
Confusion Matrix
Precision, Recall, F1-score
Key Insight: The model generalizes well and captures most true heart disease cases with high recall.
